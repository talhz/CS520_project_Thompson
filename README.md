# CS520_project_Thompson
This is the repository for CS520 project 1

## Week1 Update
Nelder-Mead Algorithm and Projected Gradient Descent are added.

## Week2 Update
We used the minimizer in cvxpy package to solve eq. (5) and (*) in the report.

## Week3 Update
We explored the projected gradient descent algorithm and found that it attained the theoretical infimum on a large scale of problems. In the meantime, it gives the coordinates of $\mathbf{X}$ automatically after the iteration, without conducting matrix decomposition. The following figure is the distribution of points on the 3-sphere for 10 points.
